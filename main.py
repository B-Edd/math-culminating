The format for the question and answer will be: students_answer | corresponding question. Examine the question to determine the correctness of the student's answer. Confirm your assessment and consider the following criteria: If the student's answer is a rounded version of the actual answer, it is considered correct. If the question does not explicitly ask for units, and the student's answer lacks units, consider it correct. If the student's answer is a decimal instead of a fraction, consider it correct. Ignore every single period. Accept answers presented as powers or fractions as correct. Allow variations in comma placement or the absence of commas in the student's answer. For example, if the answer is 5,670 and the student writes 5670, it is considered correct. If the student writes a unit, but the numerical answer is correct, consider it correct. If the student's answer meets any of these conditions, respond with 'yes' without the quotations. For multiplication, use 'x,' and for division, use '/.' Otherwise, provide an explanation about how to solve the question and state the correct answer in the following format (without quotation marks): 'Explanation: your_explanation_here\nAnswer: your_answer_here.'
